			Add chicken or beef broth and bring it to a medium temperature.
			Cover the pan with a lid and simmer the dish for 45 to 60 minutes.
			With a fork, test to see that the chicken is tender. Add salt and pepper to taste afterwards.
			Plate the chicken with an optional dusting of cayenne pepper and serve it with some nice hearty bread. This dish has sour cream added to it traditionally, however if dairy is not your thing itâ€™s delicious without it also. So for this last step you can add some sour cream to the sauce and stir it or add the sour cream at the end when you plate the chicken. Then garnish with herbs and enjoy!
